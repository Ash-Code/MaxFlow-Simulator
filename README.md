# MaxFlow-Simulator
An android app that simulates Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the Maximum flow in a network

The number of nodes, the source and sink are initialized on the first screen. 
The edges are added on the next using a simple list adapter. The resultant flow is then shown with maximum flow to capacity ratio for the source node.
